              I'm Thu Ngo, a slothful creature from earth who loves to write code and think about life.

              I'm not lazy, I'm on energy saving mode. I prefer to take my time to understand things 
              before implementing them. This approach has taught me that slow and steady often wins the race.

              I'm an extroverted introvert, if that makes sense. I love people, but I also love being alone. 
              Programming is perfect for this dualityâ€”I can spend hours in deep focus, solving problems in solitude, 
              but I also thrive in code reviews, pair programming sessions, and team discussions.

              The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know. And that's exactly what makes this field 
              so fascinating. There's always something new to explore, always a different way to solve a problem.

              I'm too old to care about the things that used to matter. Now I just want to build things that work, 
              that serve their purpose without fanfare.
